**Pizzly makes it fast and reliable to build API integrations**. It handles dozens of pre-configured APIs (including Salesforce, Slack, Google Sheets [and many more](#supported-apis)) and lets you quickly add more APIs with a generic JSON configuration schema.

Using Pizzly your engineering team can focus on consuming APIs, in a standardized way that will grow as you grow.

## How it works?

At the heart of Pizzly is a Node.js application that uses PostgreSQL as a database. Once deployed on your servers, each instance of Pizzly provides multiple tools to help developers with their API integrations, including:

- **a dashboard** - _to enable and configure APIs_;
- **an auth service** - _to handle the OAuth-dance_;
- **a proxy** - _to perform authenticated requests to an API_;
- a JS library - _to connect a user and perform requests from your frontend_;
- and its own API - _to programmatically do what you can do with the dashboard_.

## Demo

A live demo of Pizzly is available [right here](https://demopizzly.herokuapp.com/dashboard/all). It's hosted on a free Heroku instance, so expect some latency. Beware also that it is a public version of Pizzly - do not save sensitive credentials on it.

Other live demo of Pizzly includes:

- [Pizzly + React](https://codesandbox.io/s/pizzly-github-react-demo-rq78z)
- [Pizzly + Vue.js](https://codepen.io/frenchcooc/pen/RwrmXJw)

## Getting started

Pizzly can be installed anywhere (AWS, Heroku, Platform.sh, etc.). Here's a quick guide:

1. First, deploy your own instance of Pizzly by clicking a deploy button below:

   | Heroku                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Platform.sh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | <a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Bearer/Pizzly" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Heroku" width="184" height="40"></a> | <a href="https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project/?template=https://github.com/Bearer/Pizzly&utm_campaign=deploy_on_platform?utm_medium=button&utm_source=affiliate_links&utm_content=https://github.com/Bearer/Pizzly" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://platform.sh/images/deploy/deploy-button-lg-blue.svg" alt="Deploy with Platform.sh" width="180" height="40"></a> |

2. Once deployed, open your app. You will land on Pizzly's dashboard.
3. Click on "Open Dashboard" and select the API you want to integrate with.
4. Now, configure the API by entering your credentials and scopes. That's all it takes to configure a new API.
5. To connect a user to this API, _in your frontend_, install [`pizzly-js`](src/clients/javascript):

   ```bash
   npm install pizzly-js
   ```

6. Then open your frontend app and copy-paste the following code:

   ```js
   import Pizzly from 'pizzly-js'

   const pizzly = new Pizzly({ host: 'pizzly.example.org' }) // Initialize Pizzly
   const myAPI = pizzly.integration('xxx-api-name') // Replace with the API slugname

   myAPI
     .connect()
     .then(({ authId }) => console.log('Sucessfully connected!', authId))
     .catch(console.error)
   ```

   This snippet code will open a popup in your browser to start an authorization flow with the provided API. On success you will obtain an `authId` which will be be used in the next step.

7. _In your frontend again_, use the previously obtained `authId` to perform a request to the API using the code below:

   ```js
   myAPI
     .auth('xxx-auth-id') // Replace with the authId previously obtained
     .get('/xxx-endpoint') // Replace with a valid endpoint of the API
     .then((response) => console.log(response))
     .catch(console.error)
   ```

   This example will perform a GET request to `/endpoint` of the API and will use the provided authId to authenticate the request.

## Documentation

Guides, tutorials and references are all available on the [Docs](/docs).

## Examples

We have several examples [in the docs](/docs/examples.md) with different APIs. Here is the first one to get you started:

```js
const pizzly = new Pizzly({ host: 'pizzly.example.org' }) // Initialize Pizzly
const github = pizzly.integration('github')

github
  .connect() // Connect to GitHub
  .then(({ authId }) => console.log('Sucessfully connected! with the authId:', authId))
  .catch((error) => console.error('It failed!', error))
```

This example will trigger an OAuth dance to the GitHub API.

üí° You'll notice that when a user is successfully connected, we received an `authId`; it's a power concept introduced by Pizzly. The `authId` acts as a reference to the OAuth payload (i.e. the `access_token` and `refresh_token`). While the `access_token` and `refresh_token` expire and/or change over time, the `authId` is always the same. Think of it as something like a user identity.

## Supported APIs

[![Some pre-configured APIs with Pizzly](/views/assets/img/docs/pizzly-preconfigured-apis.jpg)](/docs/supported-apis.md)

More than 50 APIs are preconfigured to work out-of-the-box. Including:

- **Communication**: Gmail, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom;
- **CRM**: Front, Hubspot, Salesforce, etc.
- **Developer tools**: BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab, etc.
- **Finance**: Xero, Sellsy, Zoho Books, etc.
- **Productivity**: Asana, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Jira, Trello, etc.
- **Social**: Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.
- **[and more...](/docs/supported-apis.md)**

Each API consists of a JSON configuration file, stored within the `/integrations` directory. Here's an example with the GitHub configuration file ([`/integrations/github.json`](/integrations/github.json)):

```json
{
  "name": "GitHub",
  "auth": {
    "authorizationURL": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
    "tokenURL": "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
    "authType": "OAUTH2",
    "tokenParams": {},
    "authorizationParams": {},
    "auth": { "accessType": "offline" }
  },
  "request": {
    "baseURL": "https://api.github.com/",
    "headers": {
      "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
      "Authorization": "token ${auth.accessToken}",
      "User-Agent": "Pizzly"
    }
  }
}
```

And adding new APIs is straightforward. Just create a new configuration file within the `/integrations` folder of your Pizzly's instance. If you feel like sharing, you can even create a PR so that other developers will be able to use it as well!

## Why Pizzly?

Pizzly originally started at Bearer.sh as a way to simplify the developer's journey and ease the building of API integrations. OAuth is a great framework, but the difficulty and wide range of implementation makes it painful to use and tends to slow down the ability to integrate with new APIs.

_But seriously, why Pizzly? We're fan of bears and fell in love with this [sweet hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly‚Äìpolar_bear_hybrid) one üêª_
